Descriptionï¼šAn autonomous UAV navigation strategy is proposed in the paper based on kinodynamic planning to solve feasible trajectories in complex environments underfnite feld of view. Effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through comparative simulation and experiment by considering planning and perceiving ranges.
